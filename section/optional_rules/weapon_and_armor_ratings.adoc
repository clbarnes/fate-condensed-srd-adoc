= Weapon and Armor Ratings

Want to tap into a little bit of that combat equipment vibe other games
have? Consider weapon and armor ratings. In short, getting hit by a
weapon will damage you more, and having armor keeps that from happening.
(You could model this with stunts, but using stunt slots might not feel
right to you.)

A *weapon* value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. If you
have Weapon:2, it means that any hit inflicts 2 more shifts than normal.
This counts for ties; you inflict stress on a tie _instead_ of getting a
boost.

An *armor* value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2
makes any hit worth 2 less than usual. If you hit but the target’s Armor
reduces the attack’s shifts to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on
your target but don’t do any harm.

Choose your range of ratings carefully. Keep an eye on how likely they
make a consequence (or worse) on a tie. We recommend a range of 0 to 4
at most.
