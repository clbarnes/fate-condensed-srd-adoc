= Full Defense

Sometimes a player (or GM) may want their character to go all-in on
using defend until their next turn, rather than taking an action on
their turn. This is called *full defense*.

When declaring full defense, you must be clear about the *focus* of your
efforts. By default, you are defending yourself (from attacks and
efforts to create advantages on you), but you may wish to specify
someone you’re protecting, or a defense against a particular group of
aggressors, or a particular effort or outcome you wish to oppose.

*While on full defense you get a +2 to all defend rolls relevant to your
declared focus*.

If nothing comes of it and you haven’t rolled to defend at all by the
time your next turn comes around, you gain a boost (*page XX*) as you’ve
gotten the opportunity to prepare for your next action. This offsets
“losing a turn” because you focused your efforts on defending against
something that didn’t happen at all.
