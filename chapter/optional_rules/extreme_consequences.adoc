= Extreme Consequences

Extreme consequences introduce an optional fourth severity of
consequence to your game: something that permanently, irrevocably
changes a character.

Taking an extreme consequence reduces stress taken by 8. When taken, you
must *replace* one of your character’s existing aspects (other than
their high concept, which is off-limits) with an aspect that represents
the profound change to the character resulting from the harm they’ve
taken.

By default, there is no option to recover from an extreme consequence.
It has become a part of the character now. At your next major milestone
you may rename it to reflect how you’ve come to terms with it, but you
can’t go back to the original aspect.

Between major milestones, a character may only use this option once.
