= Faster Contests

Some groups may feel contests involve too many attempts to create
advantages per exchange. For those groups, try the following method: In
each exchange of a contest, each participant may choose only one of
these three options:

* Make the overcome roll for their side (*page XX*).
* Roll to create an advantage, but no teamwork bonus (*page XX*).
* Provide their teamwork bonus to their side’s overcome roll or
another’s attempt to create an advantage. Don’t roll.
