= Character Creation As You Play

If a player is comfortable making quick creative decisions in the
moment, they may enjoy creating characters _as they play_ rather than
ahead of time. This mimics the way characters reveal themselves and
develop in other media. It’s not for everyone, but for groups where the
method clicks it can be a real crowd-pleaser.

With this method, characters start with only a name, high concept
aspect, and highest skill—if that! As play progresses and they are
called on to use an unrated skill, they can choose an empty slot and
reveal their knowledge of it in the moment. Similarly, aspects and
stunts can be filled in when the circumstances that call for them, right
in the moment a fate point is spent or a bonus claimed.
